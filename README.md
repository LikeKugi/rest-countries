Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - An opinionated code formatter

### What I learned

I learned variables in CSS with SCSS modules in React

```js
// .eslintrc.cjs
module.exports = {
  "rules": {
    "react/react-in-jsx-scope": "off",
  }
};
```

### Continued development

Next I want to learn about tests in React
